We provide three scripts:

- `csv2npy.py`: Converts CSV files to NP files
- `readData.py`: Reads NP files
- `imgshow.py`: Visualizes NP files

The main Python dependencies include: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`.

If you need to use these scripts, simply modify the file paths and directory paths as needed.
