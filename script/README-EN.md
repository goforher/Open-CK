We provide three scripts: `csv2npy.py` for converting CSV files to NP arrays, `readData.py` for reading NP arrays, and `imgshow.py` for visualizing NP arrays.

The main Python dependencies involved are: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`.

If you need to use these scripts, simply change the file paths and directory paths as needed.
